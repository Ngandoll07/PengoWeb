Thank you for attending the publications that are made for a cookbook by the famous chef Tina Campbell.
In 30 minutes, she will give a talk about how to introduce some of her secret recipes.
In the meantime, feel free to read the book, enjoy the recipe samples or purchase a copy after the talk.
She will shine copies of the cookbook for August.
