Welcome to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. We hope your tour is informative and enjoyable.
Since there are a lot of visitors here today, we will divide it into two groups.
After completing the tour, you may visit the gift shop on the first floor,
enjoy a meal in the cafeteria or learn about upcoming exhibits at the Information Desk.
